# wl_soldiers
Widelands soldiers fight simulation. In the Widelands' world the fitghts are pseudo-random fights between two soldiers. The fights are always to death. This simulation counts how many soldiers survive the fitght. The number of fights is limited, but very high. This pseudo-random calculations try to find probability of win in that situation.

The model is described on Widelands [wiki page](https://wl.widelands.org/wiki/SoldierLevels/).
